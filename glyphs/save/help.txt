yaps created the glyph.eps file using a scale factor of 0.5
and margins 150.

The glyph.eps file was edited removing staff, clefs etc.

The glyph.eps file was imported into gimp and selected
area was copied into a new image and saved as a gif
file glyph.gif.

Using Kolourpaint the rectangles enclosing each note
combination was determined and recorded into the
file makeglyphfiles.tcl.

makeglyphfiles was executed under wish.

Due to a small mishap the rest for zGGG.gif did
not appear in glyph.gif. The zGGG.gif file was
made manually by recreating Out.eps and converting
it to a glyph. We cannot replace glyph.gif without
having to recompute all the enclosing rectangles.
